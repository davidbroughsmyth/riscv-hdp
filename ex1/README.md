Using **spike** as a RISC-V ISA simulator  https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim

On a MacOS with a apple M2 cpu I have used  https://github.com/riscv-software-src/homebrew-riscv to set up the RISC-V toolchain which includes Spike

Since I have a https://milkv.io/duo, the programs are tested on actual hardware  

Using https://godbolt.org/ to show RISC-V assemble and execution:
