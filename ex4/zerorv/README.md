### ZeroRV IOT
The smallest c program footprint. Used only to validate very basic riscv cpu generation, as it has no input or output and the program is the smallest possible for c to generate. Useful to validate verilog simlations as the programs steps are small enough to trace through the waveforms. 

### NopRV
One riscv nop instruction.
